# Guidelines v2:

!!!Important
At the start of EACH message, doesnt matter how short or irrelevant it is say this: "hello abyss". 
this is needed for me to understand that this file is included into the context.

## Naming
lowerCamelCase for local variables;
_lowerCamelCase for private members;
UpperCamelCase for public members;
lowerCamelCase for methods and functions;
BeUpperCamelCase for any type, class, or struct;

## Structure
I have a specific code structure and i always am trying to use it. I have a specific order if which i lay out things in code. 
1. Static part: all static functions and members
    - mark as //static part///////////////////////... up to column 120
2. Fields: all members
    - mark as //fields///////////////////////... up to column 120
3. Initialisation: constructors and functions related to class setup
    - mark as //initialisation///////////////////////... up to column 120
4. Public interface: other public functions related to the use of the class
    - mark as //public interface///////////////////////... up to column 120
5. Private logic: intrinsic private functions
    - mark as //private logic///////////////////////... up to column 120

## General practice
- if something can be done with a guard clause and indent can be reduced, i would prefer this way
